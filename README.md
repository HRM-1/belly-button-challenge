This dashboard delves into the intriguing Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which meticulously documents the diverse array of microbes inhabiting human navels. The dataset unveils a fascinating revelation: a select few microbial species, termed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the study, were found in over 70% of individuals, contrasting with the relative rarity of the remaining species.

The dashboard comprises two visually informative charts: a bar chart visually representing the sample values of OTUs and a bubble chart displaying each sample. The interactive feature empowers users to selectively explore the top ten OTUs, with the added capability to view demographic details associated with each selection.
